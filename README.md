Customer churn is one of the most important challenges faced by subscription-based businesses like telecom, SaaS, and streaming services. Retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, so understanding why customers leave is critical.

In this project, I analyze a telecom dataset to:

Explore churn patterns through data visualization

Identify the key drivers of churn

Provide actionable business insights

The project demonstrates my ability to work on an end-to-end data analysis pipeline — from data cleaning and exploration to predictive modeling and insights.

-> Dataset

Size: ~7,000 customer records

Features: 21 (customer demographics, services, contracts, charges, etc.)

Target variable: Churn (Yes / No)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python: Data manipulation & modeling

Pandas, NumPy: Data cleaning & preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & visualization

Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

->Exploratory Data Analysis

Compared churn vs. different services:

Phone service, Internet service, Streaming services

Online security, Online backup, Tech support

Visualized churn distribution across contract type, tenure, monthly charges

Added countplots, bar labels, and subplots for clear comparisons

-> Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts are far more likely to churn compared to yearly contracts.

Customers without online security or tech support have 2x higher churn risk.

High monthly charges are linked with increased churn.

Tenure is strongly negatively correlated with churn → long-term customers are more loyal.
